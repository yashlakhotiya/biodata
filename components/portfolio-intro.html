    <p class="intro-text">
        Welcome to my creative world! I'm <strong>Prakirti Lakhotiya</strong>, a software engineer by profession and a creative artist at heart.
        My passion lies in understanding animal behavior (which I find more fascinating than Netflix), capturing the beauty of nature through photography,
        and creating immersive musical experiences in the EDM genre. When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost in cinematic storytelling,
        stargazing under the night sky, or producing electronic music. Each piece of work reflects my unique perspective on life —
        where technology meets creativity, and every project tells a story.

    <p class="intro-text">
        I believe everything in this universe is connected at a fundamental level.
        When you look closely, every living and non-living thing is built from the same essence — electrons, protons, and ultimately, pure energy.
        We are made from the remnants of the Big Bang and supernovae, stardust arranged in intricate patterns that gave rise to self-awareness.
        The way this energy has come together determines whether it forms a human, a tree, or even a table.
        This realization deeply shapes how I see life — as a continuum of creation, consciousness, and curiosity —
        inspiring me to explore, build, and create with purpose and wonder.
