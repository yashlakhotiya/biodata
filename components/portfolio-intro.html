    <p class="intro-text">
        Welcome to my creative world! I'm Prakirti Lakhotiya, a software engineer by profession and a creative artist at heart.
        My passion lies in understanding animal behavior (which I find more fascinating than Netflix), capturing the beauty of nature through photography,
        and creating immersive musical experiences in the EDM genre. When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost in cinematic storytelling,
        stargazing under the night sky, or producing electronic music. Each piece of work reflects my unique perspective on life,
        where technology meets creativity, and every project tells a story.
